SuperHack is an annual high-school engineering hackathon for young women, non-binary and gender diverse students hosted by the Melbourne University Electrical Engineering Club (MUEEC).

Every year, we invite female, non-binary and gender diverse students from schools across Victoria to compete in teams to solve engineering design challenges based on a real industry problem.

Being an engineer is all about creative invention and problem-solving. However, oftentimes we can feel discouraged from engineering due to its reputation of being too abstract or gendered.

At SuperHack, we want engineering to feel relatable and show that it can be used to help people improve lives. We aim to teach young women, non-binary and gender diverse students the core concepts behind engineering through a fun and engaging challenge, whilst providing them with an opportunity to talk to industry mentors and university students in STEM.

While the challenge itself varies every year, the central theme of teaching young women, non-binary and gender diverse students to innovate, help others, and change the world through engineering remains. 

Home automation was the theme and challenge in previous years. Over the course of a weekend, students had to learn about electronics and Arduinos and apply that knowledge to address a need or demand related to automation at home.

SuperHack has run successfully in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022, 2023, 2024!
