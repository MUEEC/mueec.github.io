MUEEC is one of the largest engineering student representative bodies at the Faculty of Engineering and IT (FEIT).

Throughout the year, we host many events ranging from makeathons and social events to technical research-based workshops through our Autonomous Robotics Research Program (ARRP).

With the support of the university, MUEEC is able to bring opportunities for practical experience, networking, and extracurricular engagement to hundreds of students at the University of Melbourne, to enrich their university experience and become highly capable individuals ready to enter the workforce.
